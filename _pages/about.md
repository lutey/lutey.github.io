I'm a PhD candidate in Financial Economics. My dissertation is exciting research that explores the possibility of using digital image processing and state of the art machine learning tools to uncover nonlinear patterns in stock prices. Such patterns would not be recognized by standard time series methods. The aim of the research is to mimic the behavior of a certified market technician.
